Bezier Curve Formulas
Linear Interpolation
	
	Degree One
	Straight line

		P(t) = (1-t)p0 + t * p1

	Degree Two
	Curve with one defining point

		P(t) = (1-t)^2 * p0 + 2(1-t)Tp1 + t^2p2

	Degree Three
	Curve with two defining points
		
		P(t) = (1-t)^3p0 +3(1-t)^3tp1 + 3(1-t)t^2p2 +t^3p3

	Degree Four
	Curve with three defining points

		P(t) = (1-t)^4p0 +4(1-t)^3tp1 + 6(1-t)^2t^2p2 + 4(1-t)^1t^3p3 + T^4p4

How to convert to x and y

	One formula for x and one for y
	3D would include z
	Do it twice, once for x and once for y

Connecting 3 Degree Curves

	Isn't a smooth transition
	Control points need to line up to make it smooth
	You could implement a snap feature to line up curves
	A setting to automatically make it a smooth transition
