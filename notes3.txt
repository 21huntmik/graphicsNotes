Key points:
	Bart sang a song

Things Written on the Board:
	Texture Questions
	Book Learning
	Homer goes 3D

TEXTURES:
	Rolling textures
		Start at the bottom and roll to the top
	
BOOK:
	Math stuff
		P(T) = A + D * T
		Moving along a vector
	
		P(S,T) = A + U * S + V * T
		
		Give points in counter-clockwise order

		24 bytes per vertex

		576 bytes to make a cube when saving vectors

		2 bytes per index numbers

		240 bytes to make a cube when saving points

	Shading
		If you are in color mode:
			When you have different colors for each point it will make a gradient?

	Current Transformation Matrix
		Multiplies all of the translations before multiplying it to create the output

	For matrix details just go watch the zoom. I don't know what's happening.
		He said he doesn't expect you to memorize it, so I guess that's good.

	More than one window
		glutCreateWindow("Window One");
		glutCreateWindow("Window Two");
		
		You could:
			int id2 = glutCreateWindow("Window Two");
			
			Why though?
	
		glutSetWindow("id1");
			
			That's why
