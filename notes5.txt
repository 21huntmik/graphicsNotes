Bart sang another song

Terrain Questions:
	When in rat view, the view moves up and down (the rat itself doesn't have to tilt)
	
		How to tilt:
			Bart doesn't know
			~Magic~
			Cross product of dy and dx vectors
			How to rotate with that info
				He still doesn't know

	How to move the water up and down:
		Calculate the time since the program started using clock function
			Divide by clocks per second
		Using t
		Sin function to smoothly transition
		Plugged t into sin function

		void AdjustWaterHeight(double t) {
			waterHeight = -2 (base height) + .2*sin(t);
		}
		//Where t is time since program started

		double GetEllapsedSeconds() {
			static int lastMilliseconds = 0;
			int currentMilliseconds = glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME);
	
			//other stuff that I didn't catch :)	
		}
		
		GetFramesPerSecond() {
			static int frames=0;
			static clock_t start_time = clock();
			
			frames++;
			clock_t current = clock()+0.0001;
			double ellapsed_time = double(current-start-time)/double(CLOCKS_PER_SECOND);
			double frames_per_second = double(frames/ellapsed_time);
			return frames_per_second;
		}

			
		AdjustWaterHeight(glutGet(GLUT_ELAPSED_TIME)*.001);
		
		There's lots of stuff in his code that could be making this work or could just be there

Chess:
	Chess will be on the midterm

	It will be due before the midterm, but you can turn it in the Monday after but not suggested

	Load data from a file

	Display Lists?

	Lighting
		
	Use polygons and drawBox() to replace quads --> On the midterm when it said to have thicker walls
		Also needs to be used on this assignment

	You need the Starter Chess file and the Revolving and Lighting file

	glEnable(GL_LIGHTING); //general lighting
	glEnable(GL_LIGHT0); //30 something lights

	You can change the color of the light!!
		change white_light[] = {1,1,1,1};
	
	Specular light?
		He doesn't know what this is, but I guess you will still need it 

	Once you do lighting, everything changes
		glColor3d has no affect now
			Now what do we do?
				It's determined by light and material I guess

	When doing animations, use GetTime();
		using static clock() and other math things

	To set color, use glMaterial
		glMaterialfv(GL_FRONT, GL_AMBIENT_AND_DIFFUSE, mat_amb_diff1); //f - floats v - vector GL_FRONT - front facing 

		Ambient - 

		Specular highlight is a different color
		
		Diffuse - main color of an object

	Pass in normal vectors first or else everything will be broken because of lighting

	Interpolation()
		"It's just a racial problem"
		This function is actually really nice though

	Lights take 4 parameters, if last is 0, it is a direction
		if last is 1, it is a light position
