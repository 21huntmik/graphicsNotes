TERRAIN
	
	Two views:
		First person
		Perch

	You will need water, valleys, and mountains in your assignment
		If you are going down hill, your perspective will tilt down
		If you are going up hill, your perspective will tilt up

	Terrain function will generate z values
	
	Terrain is usually not made like this for real games
		Similar, but not quite

	Sometimes random fractals are used to generate terrains
		Rough mountains

	Or use sin and cos just like we are doing for this assignment
		Smooth hills

	Instructions:
		Make a grid 100 x 100
			It will be flat at first
		
		You could start with the maze assignment if you want, you just won't need the walls
			Probably just start over. Reusing maze is complicated. Use it as a reference.

		Start with perch view and then move onto first person

		How to make the hills -- assigning height
			float function(float x, float y) {
				float z = 0;
				float zscale = 0.75;
				z += 2*sin(.4*y);
				z += 1.5*cos(.3*x);
				z += 4*sin(.2*x)*cos(.3*y);
				z += 6*sin(.11*x)*cos(0.03*y);
				return z*zscale;
			}

			//he also has these above the function but said not to include them
			float X[resolution+1][resolution+1];
			float Y[resolution+1][resolution+1];
			float Z[resolution+1][resolution+1];

			//basically all you need to do is change the numbers for zscale
			//make them kind of random

			//multiply outside, it makes it taller
			//multiply inside the (), it changes the amount of peaks

			//subtract or add inside (), shifts starting point, shifts x
			//subtract or add outside, shifts y 
		
		"Your first attempts are going to look dumb" - Bart

		It would be super cool if you had different textures depending on the height of the tile
			Then you could have snow on the tops of the hills and flowers in the valleys :)
			You would still have to tile this way
			Use images that are MADE for tiling. Repeating patterns. Just search seamless patterns.
			Or be smart like Levi :)
				Reflect your images in Photoshop 4 times and that will be your new tile

		Or you could do solid colors and your program will do shading for you

		"it's too old" - Bart about his sample code

		There's a sample project that has music
			And fog

		And there was that weird truck one too
